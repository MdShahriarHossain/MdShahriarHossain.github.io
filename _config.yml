title: Md Shahriar Hossain
description: Hello! Welcome to my website. Iâ€™m Shahriar Hossain, a Mechanical Engineering graduate with a keen interest in Fluid Dynamics, Fluid Flows, and Aerodynamics, especially Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation.  In two different research projects, I have worked on aerodynamic performance. The first focused on analyzing the aerodynamic performance of the NACA 4412 airfoil, while the second was about the Archimedes spiral wind turbine. CFD simulation was conducted in both research works. Additionally, I have comprehensive knowledge of heat transfer and proficiency in MATLAB, ANSYS Fluent, COMSOL, and Python programming. I am currently an MS student at BUET (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology). Upon completing my MS, I aim to pursue higher education to gain comprehensive knowledge in my research field. I also devote myself to maintaining apprised of the newest industry developments and trends.
